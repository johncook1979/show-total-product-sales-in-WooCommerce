# Show total product sales in WooCommerce

This short snippet will allow you to display the total number of product sales. This can be used for social proof to drive more sales. You can modify the code to display the message all of the time (not recommended as it will display 0 sales on items that have no sales) or conditionally after a certain number of sales.
